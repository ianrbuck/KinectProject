Platform game using unity, kinect and oculus rift.
The player is one or two hands which must eject objects or characters from a platform.

 ###first objective :
	* Create a platform, with an object on it.
	* Be able to move the object when hitting it with kinect movements.
	* Be able to detect if the object has been ejected or put ko.
	
 steps :
	0. learn how to use unity (code and interface)
	1. create object which moves and rotate in sync with kinect (the hands)
	2. create object which move/react when hit by "hands"
	3. create game states (level begin, level done, etc)
	(opt). map a hand model to the kinect skeleton
